Hands-on AWS lab documenting the design and implementation of a custom VPC architecture from scratch.  
🧪 **AWS Lab – Designing a VPC from Scratch**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents a hands-on AWS networking lab where I designed and implemented the networking foundation of a cloud architecture starting from an empty VPC, configuring every component manually without using AWS wizards or defaults.

The goal of this lab was to deeply understand how AWS VPC networking works under the hood and to apply best practices for scalable and secure network design.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a custom VPC without using AWS wizards or default configurations  
- Apply best practices for network segmentation and scalability  
- Understand core AWS networking concepts through hands-on implementation  

---

## 🛠️ What I implemented

- ✅ Custom VPC with a `/16` CIDR block  
- ✅ DNS Resolution and DNS Hostnames enabled  
- ✅ Private subnet (`/24`) for workload isolation  
- ✅ Internet Gateway created and correctly attached  
- ✅ Structured network design focused on scalability and security

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- IP addressing and subnet planning  
- Network isolation and segmentation  
- Internet connectivity using an Internet Gateway  
- Core AWS VPC components and their interactions  
- Infrastructure design thinking
