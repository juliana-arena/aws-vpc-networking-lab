Hands-on AWS lab documenting the design and implementation of a custom VPC architecture from scratch. 🧪 AWS Lab – Designing a VPC from Scratch

This repository documents a hands-on AWS networking lab where I designed and implemented the networking foundation of a cloud architecture starting from an empty VPC and configuring every component manually.

🎯 Objectives

Build a custom VPC without using AWS wizards or defaults

Apply best practices for network segmentation and scalability

Understand core AWS networking concepts through hands-on practice

🛠️ What I implemented

✅ Custom VPC with a /16 CIDR block

✅ DNS Resolution and DNS Hostnames enabled

✅ Private subnet (/24) for workload isolation

✅ Internet Gateway correctly attached

✅ Structured network design focused on scalability and security

🧠 Key learnings

IP addressing and subnet planning

Network isolation and segmentation

Internet connectivity using IGW

AWS VPC fundamentals and architecture design

Infrastructure design thinking
